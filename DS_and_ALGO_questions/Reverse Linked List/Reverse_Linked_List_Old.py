        The idea is very simple. We need to take one node at a time like it's a new linked list. Then we keep on pointing
        the upcoming nodes to the separated out nodes. This way our linked list will be reversed.
        For eg:- 1->2->3. Now, we will take node 1 and point its next to None. Then we will take node 2 and point it to
        node 1 i.e. 2.next = node 1. Similarly, we will point node 3 to node 2 i.e. 3.next = node 2. This will reverse the list.
